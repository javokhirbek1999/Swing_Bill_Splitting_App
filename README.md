# Bill Splitting Software 

<h4>Here is my another bill splitting software that I have build using the most popular framework of Java's Swing.</h4>
<br/>
<p>In my last repo, I have mentioned that I just finished Swing course, so today I have build a simple bill splitting software using Swing to practice my new fresh skills. Well, learning Swing has been pretty easy. Actually, I have spent around 2 hours per day to learn Swing and it took me only 4 days to learn it. Within those 4 days, I have built 3 Swing Applications which I am going to list down below: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/javokhirbek1999/Price_Setter_Price_Checker_System_Design_by_Javokhirbek">Price Setter and Price Checker App<a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/javokhirbek1999/Swing_Bill_Splitting_App">Bill Splitting Software</a> (current project)</li>
<li><a href="#">FlashCard Maker</a></li>
</ol>
<p>So these are the projects that I have build within 4 days of learning Swing Framework. I have already shared the first one a couple of days ago on GitHub(you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/javokhirbek1999/Price_Setter_Price_Checker_System_Design_by_Javokhirbek">here</a>). It is pretty simple but yet very helpful that saves your time when you need to make a list of things and their prices respectively.</p>
<br/>
<p>As for this project, it is especially aimed for Supermarkets, restaurants and even for personal use. This is a Bill Splitting software that which is pretty handy when you need to split the bill and calcuate it for each person. My this software makes it very easy.</p>

<h4>How to use it ?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Enter the total amount of bill into the first field</li>
<li>Enter the total number of people into the second field</li>
<li>And you can see the amount of bill to pay for each people</li>
</ol>
</br>
<p>I do hope you like my project. <br/>
Today, I have started learning JavaFX which is the most popular library that we can use to build professional, awesome and e-catching UIs. I will build more projects using those frameworks and libraries.</p>
<p>And lately I have been focusing more on improving my System Design skills as well as Data Structures and Algorithms</p>
<p>I do hope you like my repos and pretty soon I will start building Backend projects using NodeJS, Django and Laravel</p>
<p>Stay safe</p>
